# Basics

# Write a method that takes someone's order
def take_order(order)
    puts "Received order for #{order}"
end

# Call the method

take_order("Pizza")

# Question:
# Can I assign it to a variable as a method? Why would I want to do this?
# No

def say_hello
    puts "Hello Ruby!"
end

say_hello
